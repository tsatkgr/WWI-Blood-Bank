		<h2>INFO</h2>
		<h3>A blood bank is something very important in life today. It allows us to take blood from someone who is willing to donate blood to someone who is in need of some. Then, it allows us to store it and then give it to someone else. There have been many hardships that were gone through by several people in order to perfect this invention. The ones that we will be talking about are William Harvey, James Blundell, and Karl Landsteiner. William Harvey was pretty much the guy who came up with the whole idea of blood transfusion. However, he decided to get the blood from animals rather than humans, because he did not know that animal blood was not compatible with human blood. Around two hundred years later, someone else solved that problem. James Blundell was the first person to do a blood transfusion in which the donor was a human. But it still only worked part of the time. That question was answered in the early 20th century by Karl Landsteiner during World War One. He found that there were different types of blood. Some humans had Type A blood, some with Type B, some with Type AB, and some with Type O. Landsteiner realized that the only way that it blood transfusions from the donor to the recipient would only work if both people had the same type of blood. Well, not exactly. Type AB blood people could donate and receive blood from type A, B, and/or AB. This proved helpful in both wars because soldiers who were in desperate need of more blood could get some more from donors with the same blood type as them. Overall, blood banks were very important and helpful in our world.</h3>
